# Kindler
Android Mobile App for Exchanging Books

Kindler provides users an easy way to access a variety of books directly from their phones. Kindler achieves this by allowing users to perform five main functions: browse books, search books, like books (put in wishlist), post books (put in My List) and exchange books. Browsing books allows users to view books the Kindler community has to offer. Search books allows users to search for books they already have in mind. Liking books allows users to show they are interested in making exchanges with other members. Posting books allows users to show the Kindler community their book collection. And exchanging books allows two users to borrow books from one another. 

Although there are other apps like Shelfie, and Goodreads, which allow users to keep track of the books they have read, or want to read, these apps do not help users obtain new books. Likewise, apps like Scribd and Kindle which allow users to access a large collection of books require users to spend money on monthly subscriptions. Unlike its competitors, Kindler gives users the best of both worlds by allowing users to access a large collection of books, for free, while offering functionality similar to apps like Goodreads. In short, Kindler is resourceful and user-friendly because it allows users display their book collection, keep track of books they want to read, and access books they want to read at no cost to users.
